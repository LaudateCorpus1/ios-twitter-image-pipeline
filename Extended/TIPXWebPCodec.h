/**
 Convenience codec for WebP support.
 Requires WebP.framework from Google (WebPDemux.framework for animation decoding).
 This codec is not bundled with __TIP__ to avoid bloating the framework with WebP stuff,
 but there's nothing preventing a consumer from using this decoder.

 @note WebP support was added to iOS 14, so it is preferable to use that decoder as it supports animated WebP images.
 @note To support Animation decoding, must be compiled with `TIPX_WEBP_ANIMATION_DECODING_ENABLED=1`
